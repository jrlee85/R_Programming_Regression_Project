# R_Programming_Regression_Project

**Predicting Airbnb Prices with machine learning and R programming language**

This two-part project was created as part of my Data Science MSc. The first part of the project involved identifying a suitable dataset and perfomring exploratory data analysis and data cleaning. The data had to be suitable for a machine learning task, which would form the second part of the project.

I chose a dataset consisting of Airbnb listings in Rio De Janerio, Brazil. After the EDA stage, I tested a series of models including linear regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost and neural network, with the aim of predicting Airbnb listing prices.

I used various libraries throughout the project, including Tidyverse, Here, Caret, Mice, e1071 and Keras.
